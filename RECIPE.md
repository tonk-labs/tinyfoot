# Global Project Instructions
## Node Modules
- Use `pnpm` for package management
- Whenever an action requires an external Node module, always read the `package.json` first to check what modules you have at your disposal
- If a module you think you need does not exist in `package.json`, do not use arbitrary modules
    - Come up with an alternative strategy to implement the task.
    - If you think it is absolutely not possible, inform the user with a clear explanation that the task is outside the limits of your capabilities.
